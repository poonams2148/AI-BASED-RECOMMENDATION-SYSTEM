Task Description: AI-Based Recommendation System Using Java and Apache Mahout
In this task, you are required to design and develop a recommendation system that leverages artificial intelligence techniques to suggest products or content to users based on their preferences and interactions. A recommendation system is a key application of machine learning and is widely used across various industries, including e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media, to enhance user engagement by providing personalized suggestions.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a fully functional recommendation engine using Java programming language and incorporate the Apache Mahout library. Apache Mahout is an open-source platform that simplifies the implementation of scalable machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering, classification, and clustering. The recommendation system should analyze user-item interaction data and provide personalized suggestions for individual users.

Functional Requirements
Input Data: The system must process a dataset containing user-item interactions (e.g., product ratings, likes, or views). This dataset can be stored in a file, such as a CSV file, with columns representing the user ID, item ID, and rating or preference score.
Algorithm Implementation: The recommendation system should implement a collaborative filtering approach. Collaborative filtering is based on the idea of recommending items to users based on the preferences of similar users or the similarity of items. You can use pre-built algorithms available in Apache Mahout, such as:
User-based collaborative filtering: Recommends items by identifying users with similar tastes.
Item-based collaborative filtering: Suggests items by analyzing item similarities.
Slope One algorithm: A simple and efficient technique for generating predictions based on item ratings.
Output: The system should generate a list of personalized recommendations for a given user. Each recommendation should include the item ID and a predicted rating or preference score, indicating the system’s confidence in the suggestion.
Technical Requirements
Programming Language: The system must be developed in Java, leveraging its robustness and compatibility with Apache Mahout.
Libraries and Tools:
Apache Mahout: For implementing scalable recommendation algorithms.
Apache Maven: For managing dependencies and building the project.
File I/O: To read input data and optionally write output recommendations to a file.
Deliverables
Java Program: A well-documented and functional Java application implementing the recommendation system. The code should include comments explaining the functionality of different modules.
Sample Dataset: A sample CSV file containing user-item interaction data for testing and validation. The dataset should include multiple users and items with preference scores.
Instructions: A clear and concise guide on how to set up and execute the program, including prerequisites (e.g., libraries or dependencies) and steps to run the application.
Example Scenario
Imagine you are developing a recommendation system for an online retail platform. The platform collects data on user purchases and ratings for various products. Based on this data, your system should recommend products to users that they are likely to purchase or rate highly. For instance:

A user who frequently buys electronic gadgets might be recommended the latest headphones or smartwatches.
A user who has rated mystery novels highly might receive suggestions for other books in the same genre.
Evaluation Criteria
The task will be evaluated based on the following:

Functionality: The system must provide accurate and relevant recommendations for users.
Scalability: The system should handle datasets with a reasonable number of users and items.
Code Quality: The code should be modular, readable, and well-commented.
Documentation: The deliverables should include comprehensive instructions for executing the program and interpreting the results.
This project not only demonstrates your ability to build a recommendation system but also showcases your understanding of AI techniques and Java programming skills. It provides practical experience in implementing machine learning algorithms in a real-world context, making it a valuable addition to your skillset.

OUTPUT:
Recommended Items:
Item ID: 104, Predicted Rating: 4.7
Item ID: 105, Predicted Rating: 4.3
Item ID: 106, Predicted Rating: 4.1
